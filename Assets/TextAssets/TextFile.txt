Professor X and I were doing research on the mysterious Accessibility Master. Rumours suggested he had found a great secret that would make the entire world accessible. Unfortunately, the Master's work was never published and he himself disappeared without a trace.
Last night, Professor X called to tell me that he had found the secret of the Accessibility Master's disappearance. I had some other commitments that evening, so I promised to see him the next morning.
I could hardly sleep that night thinking about the reason for the Professor's call. The excitement I'd heard in his voice made me curious. What in the world had he found?
The next morning, I rushed to the library.
The Professor was not there. Then I saw a note on the floor. I immediately recognized the Professor's writing.
The note said that the Professor had discovered a secret labyrinth built by the Accessibility Master beneath the library.
According to the Professor, the entrance to the labyrinth was hidden behind the old clock, and it unlocked only at midnight.
But the clock is broken. The hands don't move. So how did the Professor open the passageway? I tried moving the hands myself...
It worked! Let's see what's inside.
