This morning I tried to open Tom's particle skimmer holding a molten core specimen with my two hands. After 10 minutes of futile attempts I was ready to stuff that piece of core up his... 

Well, Tom is a brilliant engineer, but his attitude sometimes drives me crazy! How many times do I have to tell him that all those machines and devices he creates for me have to be easily operated not just by hands but also by something else, like a foot, an elbow... a long stick, for pity's sake!

I think I need to teach Tom a lesson and I might just know how! For the last couple of months I have been experimenting with a new insulation material. It is extremely strong and can only be pierced by something sharp and pointy, like an arrow.

I filled the entire room next to the exit with air balloons made of the material. Now I'd like to see him try and make his way to the exit using his bare hands!

After pestering Tom for two months, I finally persuaded him to create a self-closing mechanism for the door to the next room.

Amazing craftsmanship as usual! However, the mechanism is too powerful. It shuts the door before I can get to it. Last night I nearly lost my fingers!

I don't want to ask Tom to look at it again. He's a nice guy, but it will likely take him another two months to fix it.

Instead, I came up with this ingenious solution: I'm going to use a freeze spray to slow down the closing mechanism!

Professor X:
I'm so glad to see you! I need your help to open the last door. It requires 13 gems to operate. I was only able to find 9. Here, take mine. Now, go and open that door!

Professor X:
Go and open that door!
